         Freedom walls provide a space where individuals can express themselves freely 
         without fear of judgment or censorship. In a world where freedom of speech is not
         always guaranteed, having a designated area for people to share their thoughts and 
         ideas is essential. These walls offer a platform for marginalized voices and can be
         a powerful tool for social change.</h6>
        <p className="mt-5">
        freedom walls can be a means of promoting creativity and artistic expression.
         Artistic works can be thought-provoking and inspire people to think critically about the
         world around them. By providing a platform for artists to showcase their work, freedom walls
          can stimulate creativity and encourage people to engage with their environment in a new way.  </p>
        <p className="mt-5 ">
        In summary, freedom walls are important because 
        they allow for free expression, build community and solidarity, and promote creativity 
        and artistic expression. By providing a safe and welcoming space for people to share their 
        thoughts and ideas, freedom walls can play a vital role in fostering a more just and equitable
        society.
